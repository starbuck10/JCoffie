## Understanding why Sudan's Failed Coups Shows why Military Reform is a Must

After reading <a href = "https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/africasource/sudans-failed-coup-shows-why-military-reform-is-a-must/">this article</a> from the Atlantic Council, I had a few thoughts I wanted to share.

This article was a description of the current coup in South Sudan and describes the military's role in causing/prolonging the power struggle in the nation that the author argues is preventing peaceful resolution.

The character Cmdr William Adama in the fictitious show/book/story Battlestar Galactica famously states that "There's a reason you separate military and the police. One fights the enemies of the state, the other serves and protects the people. When the military becomes both, then the enemies of the state tend to become the people." This is precisely the position that South Sudan finds themselves in at the moment.  They have a largely disenfranchised and marginalized military, little to no middle class, and a power hungry political faction, all vying for power and recognition, what the auther describes as a fear of being marginalized or becoming irrelevant with the "new" South Sudan.  Simultaneously, the South Sudanese governments have used their military in a vastly inappropriate manner for a democracy, leveraging their forces for policing their own citizenry in the best case, and using the military to eliminate opposing factions in the worst.  

With growing instability along the border with Ethiopia, South Sudan finds themselves leaderless, at risk of losing tremendous amounts of western aide, and under threat from warring bands in adjacent countries, naturally lending to the military's current position that they should be in charge to establish stability and safety across their borders.  Unfortunately, the military cannot enforce a democracy and should ultimately remain out of the system completely, as they are more apt to hinder a democracy than to help, accountable to only the position of authority and not the person themselves, something that South Sudan has yet to accomplish from their inception.  Until the military removes themselves from the internal power struggles of South Sudan, we will not discover stability in the region and South Sudan will continue to be at risk from continual governmental collapse.
