## Universal Basic Income as a Global Aide Solution

Universal Basic Income, or UBI, is an experimental concept/program that provides basic income to families without receiving a service in return in an effort to boost economic standing and promote a more grassroots, bottom up approach to providing aide.  In most global development programs, aide is provided for individual projects or is distributed at the governmental level with the expectation that these governments will appropriately distribute funding to the best areas for growth and development within their area of influence.  In the past couple of years, after decades of little progress to eradicate hunger and poverty from the World through these programs, and amidst ongoing critique on the effectiveness of aide programs, many researchers are beginning to wonder if the best course of action is to simply hand funds to the lowest levels of society (and eventually to all World citizens) to minimize the wealth gap, remove the need for basic sustenance programs, and limit the waste and corruption that current development programs create and foster.  Advocates for the program state that this is the only proven successful approach to global aide while opponents mention that creating a UBI will just artificially inflate markets and will encourage people to spend their un-earned monies on alcohol, drugs, and prostitution.  All around the World, we’re finding more and more UBI programs entering the wild and producing spectacular results.

In South Sudan, a country fraught with war, conflict, and over 340% inflation in the past year, Universal Basic Income seems like a God-send in times when finding food is difficult at best.  Under a World Bank and donor countries program, monitored by the IMF, the South Sudanese government received $820mil to distribute a temporary basic-income dispersement to 24 million people over six months, at a rate of $5USD to each person, covering approximately the poorest 80% of its 43 million population.  This means that a typical family of 6 would receive about $30 in aid per month.  In an area where a survey of 3,000 families across Sudan demonstrated that 30% of all participants were unable to buy simple food staples, this is a lifeline to survival and gives families the option to pay off debt, purchase food, or use the money in a way that would help them navigate out of the poorest conditions in the World.  Although results of this experiment in 2021 are not available for review, the government hopes to “use the program to facilitate a permanent social safety net for the poorest million families”[^1] and the impact to a reduction in hunger and debt is already being noted.

In India, UNICEF experimented with an unconditional basic income program in which modest cash payments were given to more than 6,000 men, women and children over an 18 month.  The only conditions for the funds were an open bank account and the funds were deposited directly into those accounts to minimize the likelihood of theft.  The outcomes of the program were:

* Strong welfare effects: Schooling, health, sanitation - all of these areas saw measurable improvement, including an increase in the socio-economic position of women and the elderly
* Strong equity effects: Improvements in narrowing the gaps of the caste system as payments were made to individuals (denoting individual capability and lack of dependency) as opposed to families
* Strong growth effects: Increase in economic activity and those in the labor force, and
* Strong emancipatory effects: Some families were able to escape debt bondage, promoting liberty, freedom, and hope [^2]

The United States has also experimented with UBI and the results out of Stockton, California are also quite encouraging.  Best summarized by The Atlantic, “Using donated funds, the industrial city on the edge of the Bay Area tech economy launched a small demonstration program, sending payments of $500 a month to 125 randomly selected individuals living in neighborhoods with average incomes lower than the city median of $46,000 a year. The recipients were allowed to spend the money however they saw fit, and they were not obligated to complete any drug tests, interviews, means or asset tests, or work requirements. They just got the money, no strings attached.” [^3]  This program demonstrated that the best way to get people out of poverty isn’t through social programs and food-banks but to simply get them out of poverty through financial means and to give those families their own choice in how to spend the funds.  Families that received the stipend saw a reduction in income volatility, they tended to spend the money on essentials, and it also doubled the households’ capacity to pay unexpected bills and ability to pay down debt.  In the worlds of one recipient, “It let me pay off some credit cards that I had been living off of, because my household income wasn’t large enough.” [^4]

Today, organizations like Give Directly offer their users the ability to perform the same service by accepting donations form anyone around the World and redistributing those funds directly to families that need a UBI.  This program allows users to donate directly on the site and the results are staggering: for everyone $1,000 donated in this manner, Give Directly sees an increase in $270 in savings for a family, $430 increase in assets, and a $330 increase in nutritional spend, while 0% of the funds are documented as being used for alcohol or tobacco. [^5]
The results of the research above are really quite encouraging - equipping people to live the life that they want to live, without fear of food safety or access to opportunity, promotes the same kind of SDG advancement that the United Nations has been working tirelessly to achieve over the last 7 decades.  The great news about these programs is that anyone can contribute to individualized UBI programs until the remainder of the World realizes that UBI programs have a tremendous economic impact on any area that leverages them.  Although not a sustainable way to promote individual participation, it does prevent the kind of “fix-it” reflex that most of the Western World is subject to through marketing and advertising campaigns; it provides a way to give and make a difference in the World in a marked way, without the additional overhead expenses of organizational support structures and without having to fly to Africa to volunteer for a few weeks.  Put simply, there isn’t a need to understand the cultural components of a people, analyze the nuances of how they might use whatever gadget an NGO believes a country might need, and little loss in the way of overhead expenditure for project completion.  

I believe that we will continue to see a rise in governmentally sponsored UBI programs in the coming years to help alleviate poverty and security issues around the World.  The negative impacts predicted by opponents of these programs should note that “evaluations generally have not found the negative impacts that many feared” as outlined by MIT’s research into UBI programs, maneuvering UBI programs into a suitable candidate for a successful future aide programs. [^6]  As a whole, the current body of evidence demonstrates that UBI programs are successful in meeting SDG targets with very little Western influence.  This allows developing nations to control their own fate without the inclusion of Western strings that often come along with the offer of funding and also means we can have larger economic impacts with much less involvement and oversight.
