## Hindsight Up Front: Implications of Afghanistan Withdrawal fro the Middle East, Wilson Center Webcast 11/2/2021

This event was an online webinar hosted by the Wilson Center on the implications of the withdrawal of US forces for Afghanistan for the middle east and covered a variety of topics in the discussion. There were five paritipcants in the webinar: Ambassador Mark Green, Rami Khouri, James Jeffrey, Melissa Khruma, and Nadia Oweidat.

The biggest takeaway from this outside event was how important civil society is given the uncertainty of international partners.  The biggest hit to the United States following the withdrawal was the uncertainty that many of our allies have on whether the US is a long-term strategic partner or if they are going to replicate past history by leaving when things get tough.  Although many in the international community understand the reasoning behind the withdrawal, there is certainly hesitation behind trusting the United States with these types of partnerships and tasks in the future, which will all have to be informed by individual nation-state policies and agendas.  Some of the panelists even went so far as to state that the US was intentionally declaring that the Middle East is of no strategic importance anymore and that they feel abandoned. [^1]

> “Many fears of withdrawal may have created questions in the minds of some about U.S. military and diplomatic staying power of the region. Others are worried about its implications for human rights and democracy promotion, not just in Afghanistan, but elsewhere. That's a lot to discuss and unpack.” – Ambassador Mark Green
