## Exploring income equality programs

After reading <a href = "https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/dec/18/incomes-scheme-transforms-lives-poor">this article</a> from the Guardian, I was sparked by inspiration regarding a universal income for all of Earth's citizens.

The blog post is a brief summary of an experiment funded by UNESCO in which more than 6,000 men, women, and children received a basic stipend as a right (no qualification other than opening a bank account, to which there was 98% compliance) over an 18month period.  The results to me fly directly in the face of the "hand-outs" arguments that many Americans hold with regard to social programs.  I prefer to liken this experiment to the next step in achieving our Star Trek like "utopia," in which every member of the World (or the Federation in the case of our analogy) has the human basic rights of food, shelter, healthcare, etc.  Granted, in Star Trek, there is no form of currency, but in this case, I think we have the next logical step of human rights - equalizing the wealth gap.  What I found most notable about this blog post is how this step-up/assistance to break through the bondage of debt and indentured servitude didn't lead to slovenly entitlement but, instead, the peoples of the study almost unequivocally used their money to improve their health, gain independence, and to give themselves hope for a brighter future.  Fantastic.  

Here are a couple of notes from the reading:

Participants in the program experience:

- Strong welfare effects: Schooling, health, sanitation...  All of these areas saw measurable improvement, including an increase in the socio-economic position of women and the elderly

- Strong equity effects: Improvements in narrowing the gaps of the caste system as payments were made to individuals (denoting individual capability and lack of dependency) as opposed to families

- Strong growth effects: Increase in economic activity and those in the labor force

- Strong emancipatory effects: Some families were able to escape debt bondage, promoting liberty, freedom, and hope
