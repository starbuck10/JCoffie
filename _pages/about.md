## About Me

I love to be at the intersection of humanity, technology, biology, and innovation, where living systems and structures inform the development of new technologies, construction methods, best-practices, and new human interaction - I love to see organic structures in everything I interact with and create and have a passion for discovery and adventure.  I'm currently completing my Master's degree at ATLAS, CU Boulder, and hope to puruse a PhD in Creative Design for materials research, beginning in the Fall of 2023.

## Personal life

I love to learn, love to sail, and love taking on the hardest opportunity in front of me; if there is a challenge that doesn't have a straight-forward answer, I'm there!  I'm an Afghanistan war veteran and take every opportunity to travel that I can with my wife and our little girls.  I love innovating and finding solutions to problems and insist on taking the community and users into account in those solutions.  Have a tough problem you're looking to solve?  Reach out and say hello! /J
