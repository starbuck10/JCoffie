## About Me

Joshua is a first-year PhD student at the Emergent Nanomaterials Lab at the ATLAS Institute at CU Boulder. He works on designing and researching nano-particle tattoo pigments that can be used as injectable biosensors and devices. Currently, he's developing an invisible, permanent sunscreen in the lab that can be applied to a personâ€™s skin, an invisible tattoo, if you will, that he hopes will be used to prevent non-melanoma skin cancer.

Joshua has a master's degree in Creative Technology and Design, with a focus on social impact, from the same institution. 

Joshua has over six years of experience as a board member of the Boulder County Extension Advisory Committee, where he contributed to the development and implementation of educational programs and services for the community. He is also a decorated veteran, having served an Executive Officer and Aide-de-camp in the US Army, where he earned multiple awards, including the Bronze Star Medal and the Combat Action Badge. Joshua is passionate about people and the environment, and enjoys sailing with his kids and exploring the world in his free time. He is driven by the mission of using his creative and technical abilities to make a positive difference in the world.

## Personal life

I love to learn, love to sail, and love taking on the hardest opportunity in front of me; if there is a challenge that doesn't have a straight-forward answer, I'm there!  I'm an Afghanistan war veteran and take every opportunity to travel that I can with my wife and our little girls.  I love innovating and finding solutions to problems and insist on taking the community and users into account in those solutions.  Have a tough problem you're looking to solve?  Reach out and say hello! /J
