## The Goal

I love sailing.  And I have a personal goal to own a blue-water sailboat that I can travel the World on.  Who doesn't have that goal, right?  Anyway, I've been working my way through certifications and hands-on experience to make the goal a reality.  Let's see how it's going!

## Step 1 - What's sailing?

Last year my brother and my mother gifted me with something that I never would have imagined would change my life - a birthday certificate to take ASA101 through <a href="https://victoriasailingschool.com">Victoria Sailing</a> here in Colorado.  I completed the course but before I made it all the way through, I knew sailing would become a hobby that would make a big difference in my own mental health by:

* Providing a mental escape from the busyness of our World
* Giving me an outlet for simplicity to help work through life's issues
* Generating a goal that could last a lifetime

I quickly signed up for the next course before my current one was complete and now I find myself wondering how to make this hobby a workable lifestyle for myself and my family.

So here's the goal: take the courses and gain the experience I need to become a full-blown ocean sailing Captain and take my family around the globe.
