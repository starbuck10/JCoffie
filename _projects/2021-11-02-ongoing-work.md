## The Goal

I love sailing.  And I have a personal goal to own a blue-water sailboat that I can travel the World on.  Who doesn't have that goal, right?  Anyway, I've been working my way through certifications and hands-on experience to make the goal a reality.  Let's see how it's going!

## Step 1 - What's sailing?

Last year my brother and my mother gifted me with something that I never would have imagined would change my life - a birthday certificate to take ASA101 through <a href="https://victoriasailingschool.com">Victoria Sailing</a> here in Colorado.  I completed the course but before I made it all the way through, I knew sailing would become a hobby that would make a big difference in my own mental health by:

* Providing a mental escape from the busyness of our World
* Giving me an outlet for simplicity to help work through life's issues
* Generating a passion that will last a lifetime

I quickly signed up for the next course before my current one was complete and now I find myself wondering how to make this hobby a workable lifestyle for myself and my family.

So here's the goal: take the courses and gain the experience I need to become a full-blown ocean sailing Captain and take my family around the globe.

## Step 1 ASA101 - Basic Keelboat

ASA101 was a series of classroom instruction and on-vessel application of sailing skills.  Here is a description of the course from ASA: "Able to skipper a sloop-rigged keelboat of approximately 20 to 27 feet in length by day in light to moderate winds (up to 15 knots) and sea conditions. Knowledge of basic sailing terminology, parts and functions, helm commands, basic sail trim, points of sail, buoyage, seamanship and safety including basic navigation rules to avoid collisions and hazards. Auxiliary power operation is not required."

My key takeaway from the course: safety, safety, safety.  A skipper must be methodical, plan ahead, and put the safety of the crew above all else.

## Step 2 ASA 103 - Basic Coastal Cruising

ASA103 builds on ASA101 and provides a deeper understanding of the operation of a sail-driven vessel.  The ASA describes this course as "Able to skipper a sloop-rigged auxiliary powered (inboard or outboard engine) keelboat of approximately 25 to 35 feet length by day in moderate winds (up to 20 knots) and sea conditions. Knowledge of cruising sailboat terminology, basic boat systems, auxiliary engine operation, docking procedures, intermediate sail trim, navigation rules, basic coastal navigation, anchoring, weather interpretation, safety and seamanship."

My key takeaway from the course: Always safely operate your vessel but don't be afraid to make it your own - calm seas don't make seasoned sailors.  Take the time to find your limits and your vessels limits and learn to operate within those confines.

## Step 3: Buy a boat and rack up the hours!

Following the completion of my ASA101 and ASA103 courses, I decided to purchase a 26' MacGregor "trailer-sailor" to continue wracking up hours and to gain experience maintaining, repairing, and upgrading my own vessel.  And here she is!

I also had the opportunity to charter boats in anticipation of ASA104 next year and to broaden my experience on a variety of vessels.  Woohoo!

## The next step in the journey

The next step in the journey is to wait out the Winter!  I was invited to join a sailing team this spring and as the weather warms, I'm looking to purchase a smaller Dinghy to continue to build up hours. I'd like to park it by a lake/reservoir so that I can build the hours necessary to gain my USCG 6-pack Captains license and progress with ASA104.  I'd also like to take the coursework necessary to begin as an ASA instructor so that I can generate additional income and continue to build our fleet.

Stretch goal of 2022: Complete my first vessel delivery and begin to develop a reputation for safety and dependability.
