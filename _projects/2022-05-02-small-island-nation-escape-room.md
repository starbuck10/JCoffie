## Project Vision and Design

## User testing

Although brief in this exhibit, we did use usability practices to design the experience... change clues, add sound to the experience

## Developing Clues in the Escape Room

Physical and digital clues

## Uh oh... Houston, we've got 100 problems and this tech is one of them!

Describe changes to the plan after prototyping (includes door locking system, escape room shell - cardboard + tent instead of wood framing + door, touchpad interface - no mac connectivity, used computer with touchscreen instead PC, short throw projector to screen, low-fidelity video instead of realistic graphics to make experience more fun and less serious)
