## Weekly 1 - Learning how to Document Textiles

For my documentation setup, I’m going to use my desk (image 1) to lay out my prototypes and textiles for documentation by relocating the printer (and fan) - I have overhead light in this space underneath the shelving as well as accent lighting and controllable natural light, so it’s ideal for this process.  I also purchased a 20x macro lens to get close-up images and the kit came with a couple of other lens that I can use to see if they will help with the documentation process as well (link: shorturl.at/bhmU0).  I have found that this setup is quite tempormental so
I may need to switch to the macro lens on a DSLR in future weeklies.

<b>Woven Object Exploration</b>

The object I wanted to explore for this assignment was a camel wool blanket that I purchased in Kandahar, Afghanistan when I was stationed there in support of Operation: Enduring Freedom.  I purchased the blanket at a bazaar and actually traded an American watch for it with the merchant - it’s a very simple design and after 10 years, it has a bit of shed but is still holding up strong.

The decoration around the outside of the blanket, which appears to be a series of geometric patterns, also provides a much need visual break from the singular color of the blanket.  It appears to also be only a single layer which would make sense because it’s a fantastic blanket to use in Spring and Fall but can be very chilly to use in the winter and overbearing in the summer.

The final couple of shots of this blanket demonstrate the general weaving pattern that the blanket uses for the more mundane component of browns, which makes up the majority of the weaving.  I find that this pattern produces a very strong blanket and after 10 years of daily usage, it still holds up quite strong.

## Weekly 2 - Making a Loom

<b>What I am setting out to do:</b>

The assignment for the week is to watch a Youtube video on making a loom using a hardcover book (link: shorturl.at/ar278) and then to get out and make one ourselves. The specifications of the build are as follows:

1. It should have at least 20 ends/warps
2. Use at least 2 colors
3. Weave those two colors in any combination
4. Integrate at least 12” of ductile yarn into the weave
5. And weave something that relates to the contents of the book
The last requirement of the assignment is to ask ourselves what else we could make a loom out of.
My approach is to use one of my hardcover sailing books and to play around with an ocean theme throughout the assignment. I chose a turquoise for the warp as well as for one of the wefts and accompanied that color with a natural raw silk and gold/brown ductile yarn. The idea is that the gold/brown could play as land, as viewed from above, the turquoise would be the ocean, and the natural raw silk tan coloration could play almost white as clouds or even as waves, depending on how each of the patterns surfaces.

A couple of things I wanted to explore were: how many differing patterns you could generate and how they should be woven to transition between them simply by using an alternating warp lift, the technicality of how each weft begins and ends (is it best to cut yarn and reinsert or to carry along the outer edging?), and discover how tension in the yarn can affect the weave pattern as a whole.

<b>Process Notes</b>

The first thing I did was construct the loom by following the instructional video above. I had the warp incredibly taught against the book in an attempt to keep the warp evenly spaced throughout the build as I reasoned that tension would be more a friend than adversary. I bound the warp tightly against the book and also triple taped the back of the loom (then stole one of those pieces to build a loom with my daughter Emmalyn). It consists of 20 warps and three differing weft colors and materials as outlined perviously. I used popsicle sticks for the heddles and half of a chopstick to guide the wefts.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly2_1.jpeg"></p>

Because I wanted to explore different interviewing with the weft to determine the technical components of the build, I decided to transition the weave pattern every couple of passes to experiment with differing conditions. The first pattern, a simple back and forth between the raw silk and the turquoise yarn transitions into just turquoise and then just raw silk (Figure 2).

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly2_2.jpeg"></p>

Following this simple beginning, I staggered a few rows of the weft back and forth and then began interweaving the conductive yarn. Once this was done for a few rows, I transitioned to a half conductive yarn and half raw silk and then back to dedicated turquoise (Figure 3). This process created a look on the textile that resembled a cloud and I thought it was a neat nod to the story of the book.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly2_3.jpeg"></p>

Next, I interwove the conductive yarn in a couple of more rows because I was curious about whether I should terminate that thread and tuck it or carry it up along the edge. The reasoning was that if I wanted to send signal along any of these bands to another, they would need to be interconnected. In the future, however, I think I would weave this thread into the passing warp rows to hide it and keep it from getting snagged (Figure 4).

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly2_4.jpeg"></p>

Finally, I ended the weave with more raw silk work and a final bit of conductive yarn. I liked this pattern because it resembled waves breaking against the shore and was a nice way to end this assignment (Figure 5).

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly2_5.jpeg"></p>

Overall, the build measures about a finger-span long and about 1.25” W. I find the pattern soothing although I can distinguish areas of inconsistent tension and a gradual narrowing of the warp as the weave continued. Once I realized that this tension was too much, I decided to begin experimenting with how the warp would lay given more tension as it progressed. The weave certainly changed in feel and texture and the distinction between colors became more obvious (Figure 6).

<b>Reflection</b>

I found this hands-on introduction to looming to be really fun and just what I needed to see how each component of the loom contributes to the design. I learned a few "less-than-desirable" techniques and began to find a rhythm when I started to understand how the heddles had to work together for increased efficiency. I had such a blast with this assignment that I actually built a smaller one with my daughter Emmalyn and we started her own textile too (Figure 7)! I should probably figure out how we keep the textile together while off the book before I get too much further.

## Weekly 3 - Warp and Weave

<b>What I am setting out to do:</b>

On this assignment, I worked with my partner Dover to weave a couple of yards of cloth at about 8” wide - we each independently wove the following: 3, 3-4” sections that experiment with a different technique, 2 inches of a tabby between each section, and integrated at least 12” of conductive thread into each experiment sections’ weave using a different technique that we make up.  The purpose of this assignment is to get comfortable with the weaving process and to play with the base structure, allowing us to study these created fabrics in person in class.

<b>Process Notes</b>

I was the second one on the loom for this assignment and Dover already created a bit of a color scheme with the portion they wove on the loom - for this reason, I wanted to create a bit of contrast between the two sections to make it easily distinguishable and also to experiment with something that I haven’t played with before.  I decided to pass my weft through the warp but then also loop it around the upper portion of the warp and back through, creating almost individual knots on each weft pass and leaving a portion of yarn exposed.  I wanted to see how difficult it would be to craft a wearable textile and to determine how well those individual threads could be used in that fashion.  I also decided to use a color advancing, wool yarn to give some fall colorization to the experience.  Within the weave itself, the color change is quite striking and produces a nice feel to the variation.  Inside this weave is a linear interweaving of conductive yarn that could theoretically be used while this part of the fabric is worn by the end use - excited to see how this use adapts and changes as I learn more and more about the weaving process.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly3_1.jpeg"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly3_2.jpeg"></p>

Following this section, I created just over an inch of plain white wool tabby, experimenting with twist and how tightly I pressed each weft into the row before it.  This created a some imagery in the final tabby section that was unexpected and gives a nice break to the naturally bland beige color that is natural wool.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly3_3.jpeg"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly3_4.jpeg"></p>

The next section that I experimented with began as a combination of corded jewelry nylon twisted around a longer stretch of conductive yarn.  With this one, I wanted to see if it was possible to rely on the strength of the nylon for the structure of the cloth while still able to pass a loose conductive yarn through.  After a few wefts, I transitioned into more 3d fabric, skipping different warps to create elevated patterns that could prove useful in wearable textiles using a purple, cotton hybrid yarn I found at Art Parts.  The looping structure seems strong enough to use as an attachment hook for the end user to wear.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly3_5.jpeg"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly3_6.jpeg"></p>

After the next ~2” of tabby using white wool, I jumped into a bit more of the three dimensional fabric world and decided to try some larger, decorative loops and even a woven pocket.  The pocket would require some additional micro-looming to finish up (consider those black jewelry nylon wefts as a sideways warp and I think you could reinforce them as woven pockets!) But it does appear to be functional.  I also played around a bit with spacing and the like to see if you could control the depth of the pocket after a few more lines are woven into the textile (turns out it’s pretty fixed in place after that point).  

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly3_7.jpeg"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly3_8.jpeg"></p>

This was the end of the required portions of the assignment but because I was having a blast trying different things, I decided to keep going and grab Dover and I that extra credit for going to the end of the loom.  Here are a couple of other things I played around with on this assignment:

<b>Reflection</b>

This was a really fun exercise in learning the tabletop cricket loom and beginning to experiment with different weft patterns.  I’m really intrigued to see what other teams developed and I REALLY want to buy one of these now.  It was really therapeutic and I enjoyed thinking up new ways that I could experiment with the possibilities.
