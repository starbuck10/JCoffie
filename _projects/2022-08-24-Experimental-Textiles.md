## Weekly 1 - Learning how to Document Textiles

For my documentation setup, I’m going to use my desk (image 1) to lay out my prototypes and textiles for documentation by relocating the printer (and fan) - I have overhead light in this space underneath the shelving as well as accent lighting and controllable natural light, so it’s ideal for this process.  I also purchased a 20x macro lens to get close-up images and the kit came with a couple of other lens that I can use to see if they will help with the documentation process as well (link: shorturl.at/bhmU0).  I have found that this setup is quite temperamental so I may need to switch to the macro lens on a DSLR in future weeklies.

<b>Woven Object Exploration</b>

The object I wanted to explore for this assignment was a camel wool blanket that I purchased in Kandahar, Afghanistan when I was stationed there in support of Operation: Enduring Freedom.  I purchased the blanket at a bazaar and actually traded an American watch for it with the merchant - it’s a very simple design and after 10 years, it has a bit of shed but is still holding up strong.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly1_2.jpeg"></p>

The decoration around the outside of the blanket, which appears to be a series of geometric patterns, also provides a much need visual break from the singular color of the blanket.  It appears to also be only a single layer which would make sense because it’s a fantastic blanket to use in Spring and Fall but can be very chilly to use in the winter and overbearing in the summer.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly1_3.jpeg"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly1_4.jpeg"></p>

The final couple of shots of this blanket demonstrate the general weaving pattern that the blanket uses for the more mundane component of browns, which makes up the majority of the weaving.  I find that this pattern produces a very strong blanket and after 10 years of daily usage, it still holds up quite strong.

## Weekly 2 - Making a Loom

<b>What I am setting out to do:</b>

The assignment for the week is to watch a Youtube video on making a loom using a hardcover book (link: shorturl.at/ar278) and then to get out and make one ourselves. The specifications of the build are as follows:

1. It should have at least 20 ends/warps
2. Use at least 2 colors
3. Weave those two colors in any combination
4. Integrate at least 12” of ductile yarn into the weave
5. And weave something that relates to the contents of the book
The last requirement of the assignment is to ask ourselves what else we could make a loom out of.
My approach is to use one of my hardcover sailing books and to play around with an ocean theme throughout the assignment. I chose a turquoise for the warp as well as for one of the wefts and accompanied that color with a natural raw silk and gold/brown ductile yarn. The idea is that the gold/brown could play as land, as viewed from above, the turquoise would be the ocean, and the natural raw silk tan coloration could play almost white as clouds or even as waves, depending on how each of the patterns surfaces.

A couple of things I wanted to explore were: how many differing patterns you could generate and how they should be woven to transition between them simply by using an alternating warp lift, the technicality of how each weft begins and ends (is it best to cut yarn and reinsert or to carry along the outer edging?), and discover how tension in the yarn can affect the weave pattern as a whole.

<b>Process Notes</b>

The first thing I did was construct the loom by following the instructional video above. I had the warp incredibly taught against the book in an attempt to keep the warp evenly spaced throughout the build as I reasoned that tension would be more a friend than adversary. I bound the warp tightly against the book and also triple taped the back of the loom (then stole one of those pieces to build a loom with my daughter Emmalyn). It consists of 20 warps and three differing weft colors and materials as outlined perviously. I used popsicle sticks for the heddles and half of a chopstick to guide the wefts.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly2_1.jpeg"></p>

Because I wanted to explore different interviewing with the weft to determine the technical components of the build, I decided to transition the weave pattern every couple of passes to experiment with differing conditions. The first pattern, a simple back and forth between the raw silk and the turquoise yarn transitions into just turquoise and then just raw silk (Figure 2).

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly2_2.jpeg"></p>

Following this simple beginning, I staggered a few rows of the weft back and forth and then began interweaving the conductive yarn. Once this was done for a few rows, I transitioned to a half conductive yarn and half raw silk and then back to dedicated turquoise (Figure 3). This process created a look on the textile that resembled a cloud and I thought it was a neat nod to the story of the book.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly2_3.jpeg"></p>

Next, I interwove the conductive yarn in a couple of more rows because I was curious about whether I should terminate that thread and tuck it or carry it up along the edge. The reasoning was that if I wanted to send signal along any of these bands to another, they would need to be interconnected. In the future, however, I think I would weave this thread into the passing warp rows to hide it and keep it from getting snagged (Figure 4).

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly2_4.jpeg"></p>

Finally, I ended the weave with more raw silk work and a final bit of conductive yarn. I liked this pattern because it resembled waves breaking against the shore and was a nice way to end this assignment (Figure 5).

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly2_5.jpeg"></p>

Overall, the build measures about a finger-span long and about 1.25” W. I find the pattern soothing although I can distinguish areas of inconsistent tension and a gradual narrowing of the warp as the weave continued. Once I realized that this tension was too much, I decided to begin experimenting with how the warp would lay given more tension as it progressed. The weave certainly changed in feel and texture and the distinction between colors became more obvious (Figure 6).

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly2_6.jpeg"></p>

<b>Reflection</b>

I found this hands-on introduction to looming to be really fun and just what I needed to see how each component of the loom contributes to the design. I learned a few "less-than-desirable" techniques and began to find a rhythm when I started to understand how the heddles had to work together for increased efficiency. I had such a blast with this assignment that I actually built a smaller one with my daughter Emmalyn and we started her own textile too (Figure 7)! I should probably figure out how we keep the textile together while off the book before I get too much further.

## Weekly 3 - Warp and Weave

<b>What I am setting out to do:</b>

On this assignment, I worked with my partner Dover to weave a couple of yards of cloth at about 8” wide - we each independently wove the following: 3, 3-4” sections that experiment with a different technique, 2 inches of a tabby between each section, and integrated at least 12” of conductive thread into each experiment sections’ weave using a different technique that we make up.  The purpose of this assignment is to get comfortable with the weaving process and to play with the base structure, allowing us to study these created fabrics in person in class.

<b>Process Notes</b>

I was the second one on the loom for this assignment and Dover already created a bit of a color scheme with the portion they wove on the loom - for this reason, I wanted to create a bit of contrast between the two sections to make it easily distinguishable and also to experiment with something that I haven’t played with before.  I decided to pass my weft through the warp but then also loop it around the upper portion of the warp and back through, creating almost individual knots on each weft pass and leaving a portion of yarn exposed.  I wanted to see how difficult it would be to craft a wearable textile and to determine how well those individual threads could be used in that fashion.  I also decided to use a color advancing, wool yarn to give some fall colorization to the experience.  Within the weave itself, the color change is quite striking and produces a nice feel to the variation.  Inside this weave is a linear interweaving of conductive yarn that could theoretically be used while this part of the fabric is worn by the end use - excited to see how this use adapts and changes as I learn more and more about the weaving process.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly3_1.jpeg"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly3_2.jpeg"></p>

Following this section, I created just over an inch of plain white wool tabby, experimenting with twist and how tightly I pressed each weft into the row before it.  This created a some imagery in the final tabby section that was unexpected and gives a nice break to the naturally bland beige color that is natural wool.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly3_3.jpeg"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly3_4.jpeg"></p>

The next section that I experimented with began as a combination of corded jewelry nylon twisted around a longer stretch of conductive yarn.  With this one, I wanted to see if it was possible to rely on the strength of the nylon for the structure of the cloth while still able to pass a loose conductive yarn through.  After a few wefts, I transitioned into more 3d fabric, skipping different warps to create elevated patterns that could prove useful in wearable textiles using a purple, cotton hybrid yarn I found at Art Parts.  The looping structure seems strong enough to use as an attachment hook for the end user to wear.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly3_5.jpeg"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly3_6.jpeg"></p>

After the next ~2” of tabby using white wool, I jumped into a bit more of the three dimensional fabric world and decided to try some larger, decorative loops and even a woven pocket.  The pocket would require some additional micro-looming to finish up (consider those black jewelry nylon wefts as a sideways warp and I think you could reinforce them as woven pockets!) But it does appear to be functional.  I also played around a bit with spacing and the like to see if you could control the depth of the pocket after a few more lines are woven into the textile (turns out it’s pretty fixed in place after that point).  

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly3_7.jpeg"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly3_8.jpeg"></p>

This was the end of the required portions of the assignment but because I was having a blast trying different things, I decided to keep going and grab Dover and I that extra credit for going to the end of the loom.  Here are a couple of other things I played around with on this assignment:

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly3_9.jpeg"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly3_10.jpeg"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly3_11.jpeg"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly3_12.jpeg"></p>

<b>Reflection</b>

This was a really fun exercise in learning the tabletop cricket loom and beginning to experiment with different weft patterns.  I’m really intrigued to see what other teams developed and I REALLY want to buy one of these now.  It was really therapeutic and I enjoyed thinking up new ways that I could experiment with the possibilities.

## Weekly 4 - Dynamic wefts

<b>What I am setting out to do:</b>

Assignment Requirements:

1. Re-warp the loom with 40-50 warps using the 3/2 pearl cotton yarn provided in class. Use string heddles to create four frames in a straight draw (this is following an attempt to use safety clips previously),
2. Collect some materials to weave with that you wouldn’t typically consider to be “yarn”,
3. Experiment with methods to integrate your material into the woven structure, and
3. Play with different functional and aesthetic possibilities and when you found a structure you like, weave 3" of it with tabby on either side. Document the structure you created in AdaCAD.org and include it in your weekly.

What I’d like to continue to play around with during this weekly assignment is building structures that hold their form and could provide protection for someone wearing them.  This is why I’ve selected a twisted danish cord and metal jewelry wire for my experimental weaves this week.  The idea is that I can see how these materials behave (how tightly I can keep each row, how they interact with the warp, etc.) and also experiment with extrusions from the cloth that could be used to hold or manage sensors.  Here is a sketch of what I am exploring:

<p align="center"><img src="/images/Concept.png"></p>

<b>Process Notes</b>

<b>Re-warping</b>

Beginning with the re-warping - we used a new method in class that uses a draw string harness but as we only had two available, many of us created our own versions.  For our version, we used a pair of clamps and a pair of dowels to replicated the harness and proceed to create our figure eight in order to keep the yarn in order throughout the warping process.  This figure eight was created using two skewers taped together and was maintained throughout the warping process to keep alignment.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly4_1.jpeg"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly4_2.jpeg"></p>

In the first iteration of building our own frames, we used safety pins (Figure 3) but found that these safety pins were a bit too large for the diameter of yarn, resulting in many warps escaping their frames and proving rather frustrating.  This led us to use string based frames and we found out very quickly how easy it is to loose track of individual warps and have to suffer through an imperfect framing setup while weaving.  We rethreaded the frames three times before deciding that we had best let the warp work itself out and see if we could still learn anything from the process, following the safety pin attempt.   

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly4_3.jpeg"></p>

<b>Materials</b>

I went to Art Pats in Boulder for my material selection for this assignment.  I selected a variety of items including:

1. Japanese Mizuhiki cord,
2. Lightly spun natural colored wool (used this for my tabby weaving),
3. A giant zipper,
4. Twisted Danish cord,
5. Coated jewelry wire,
6. A photograph that I eventually cut into strips, and
7. A fabric ribbon with dangling balls sewn onto it.

My original intention for the assignment was to use the strips of photographs as a weft to create wearable imagery but I later decided this didn’t interest me as much as it did when I purchased it for some reason. Instead, I felt more drawn to the twisted cord and the jewelry wire as functional textiles and decided to give these a go.  I did notice that getting creative with wefts is pretty tough as you need a flexible and long fiber capable of stress and keeping and/or changing form.  It seemed to me that there is a definitive departure from manufacturing textiles when you choose something that can’t be woven for more than one row and elected to go with my materials of choice.

<b>Weaving</b>

It was a bit obvious from the warping phase that we would run into issues with a consistent pattern of warps exposed per frame lift.  To make matters worse, I also used a very fluffy fiber for my weft, using a lightly spun wool that didn’t help in keeping the patterning clean.  Often, the warps and wefts would entangle themselves in the frame yarn and keep warps elevated (or descended) and many different “loose” warps surfaced, even in the beginning tabby weave.  I decided to continue along and do a few more rows of individual heddle lifts  and hope to straighten out the warp structure.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly4_4.jpeg"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly4_5.jpeg"></p>

After completing 3” of tabby, I started on part one of my unusual weft assignment and began weaving through jewelry wire.  It was interesting in that I could keep the width of the textile even with very sharp turn-arounds with each pass but the thickness of each weft in the cloth was problematic.  Curious as to effect of wire against a fragile warp, I decided to try out using floats in the middle of the textile for my functional attachment loops and created a fairly gentle loop in the wire and reinserted after skipping the 4 middle warps.  I concluded that if I were going to place a bunch of string on a particular warp it would be best for that strain to be toward the middle of the cloth so as to provide a maximum safety margin between edges.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly4_6.jpeg"></p>

After weaving the jewelry wire, I was able to shape the textile and have it maintain its form, which is exactly what I was hoping to achieve.  An unexpected benefit of the additional wire loops, however, was how it allow the cloth to stretch in that area more than in other areas, something that could be looked at further if attempting to account for joints of points of flex in designing clothing (think, accounting for an elbow).

The next experimental material was twisted danish cord.  I found myself admiring it as a material for its resistance to compression and wanted to see if it could provide marginal protection against protruding objects by simply weaving it into the class with varying amounts of warp/weft exposure.  I begin using a tabby weave and quickly ascertained how well this material worked as a weft while only using 1 in every 4 warps (Figure 7).  The textile remained rigid on the exterior but when more weft was exposed, the softness of the reverse side of the cloth attested to the value of being able to integrate this material into a cloth without too much skin irritation.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly4_7.jpeg"></p>

After completing the experiment with the danish cord, I wove 4” of tabby, 3” for the assignment and 1” for cutting off and re-warping.  Needless to say, I cut off each of the four frames during rewarping and completely reassembled the loom for our next assignment.

<b>Documenting</b>
 The experimental portion that I wanted to document was the jewelry wire - I find this weft so fascinating because of the malleability of the wire.  You can stretch and bend this wire many times without it becoming rigid or brittle and it takes very little effort to see this effect.  In this documentation, I wanted to show the variations on the heddle lifts as well as the float in the middle for the hook like structure.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/AdaCAD4.jpeg"></p>

<b>Reflection</b>

The yarn used in creating yarn-based frames like used above must have very little tendency to cling to adjacent yarns in order to be effective and not completely stressful as a substitute for traditional frames.  I rewarped the loom already for the next assignment and rebuilt all of the frames in the process and found that this new fiber holds up to wear quite a bit more (it’s hemp) and also slides easier along the cotton (Figure ).  I will be interested to see if this is an easier way to use more frames given that the frame is less likely to attach to the warp.

## Weekly 5 - Embodying Weave Structure, Making Swatches

<b>What I am setting out to do:</b>

This is a 2-week weekly assignment that consists of the following parts:

1. Complete the reverse drafting worksheet with a swatch that will be provided to you in class. Follow each step on the worksheet carefully and make notes and comments about what you learned through this process in your weekly write up. Please bring your physical worksheet to class on Oct 10 for grading as part of this weekly.
2. Find a different woven sample and try to come up with an explanation of how it was drafted. What structures were used in what combinations. Use terminology from weaving in your explanation such as interlacement, float, tabby, twill, satin, etc.
3. Spend 2 hours weaving on the 8-shaft loom (an appointment calendar is available via Canvas). Listen to your favorite album, weave something that reminds you of the music. Focus on the feel, giving yourself room to play. Leave your work on the loom and weave a 2" tabby header after your work to prep the loom for the next person. Include images of what you made and how you went about doing it

Bonus: As you weave on the 8 shaft, somehow integrate two separate conductive yarns such that when you move the swatch (fold, stretch, twist), the two threads connect and conduct electricity. Include images of what you made and how you went about doing it

Here are my thoughts on the assignment and each of its parts:

1. Not much planning for this one, apart from getting a unique swatch.  I know that I’ll get more comfortable with drafting with practice so I’m hoping to get one that changes structures often.
2. I’d like to give this analysis a try on a woven fabric that I can’t take apart.  I’m not sure why, but I feel like it would be useful to get some practice learning from things that can’t be decomposed.  For this reason, I will most likely pick the woven blanket from the first assignment and analyze the decorative banding around the outside.
3. I’m really excited for this one - I’ve really come to enjoy weaving and playing with an 8-shaft for a few hours would be really great.  I’ve been quite curious about creating larger textiles with more complex patterns and my mind often wanders to what I could create using this more complex style loom while introducing biological and regenerative materials.  I’m thinking I’ll pick an album from my youth and pick a night slot on the loom so I can weave without worrying about interruptions.  
4. Bonus: I haven’t tried integrating the yarn in a way that is as near as invisible as possible and I’d like to create two “buttons” that are across from one another.  As I’m not familiar with the tie-up of this loom quite yet, I’m wondering if I will have to be flexible with how I integrate this yarn, particularly if both sides of the textile have very differing shaft configurations.

<b>Process Notes</b>

The first part of this assignment is working with the swatch and building a draft plan to determine how the textile was made.  I chose a particularly troublesome cloth (from my amateur perspective, that is) but wanted as many color variations as possible to help keep the individual warps and weft picks as easily visible as possible.  It turned out, however, that the variation in colors didn’t make it a lick easier as the beating process pushed the picks together in a way that they overlapped significantly and pulling out each one for documentation inevitably pulled the adjacent pick out with it.  Needless to say, I had to make some manual error corrections looking at the original cloth picture after the fact and leveraging the knowledge this was produced on an 8-frame loom and not one with more frames.  Here is an image of the cloth that I was working with:

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly5_1.jpeg"></p>

I rotated the cloth 90* clockwise for the exercise and the variation in so many structures over a small area also proved difficult to navigate for the task - each pulled thread made the textile noticeably less stable and I often found that I was pushing weft picks back into place while attempting to restore them to their original place.  Overall, the activity was very informative and I finally have a handle on how to build a drafting plan out of a sample textile.

I worked through the draft by hand with pencil/paper at first and quickly migrated to excel/numbers as it kept my thoughts in order better than the erase and redraw method of doing it by hand.  After analyzing the threads, the next step was to draw the tie-up plan - this process was particularly difficult because of the overlap of weft picks. However, by going through each warp, it became evident that many of the original markings on my sheet were only a single cell off, and by adjusting them to match previous warps, I was able to figure out the pattern and work through any mis-steps.  Here is the final draft!

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly5_2.jpeg"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly5_3.jpeg"></p>

For the other woven object, I decided to choose the Afghan wool blanket that I purchased in a Kandahar bazaar.  The blanket itself is woven using a twill pattern and the border around the outside uses a diamond design twill weave in the center, alternating between tabby and intentional floats to create a consistent pattern - this maximizes interlacement around the edged banding of the blanket while still allowing a less-interlaced twill pattern to hold the majority of the textile’s structure.  The ends of the blanket are a twisted fringe and the material itself is brown, red, and white camel wool - please see the end of this assignment for images.

Probably the most fun I’ve had so far this semester was working on the 8 shaft loom from 8-10pm on a Friday night, throwing picks while listening to music all by myself.  The album of choice? The Classic Crime’s album titled “Phoenix.”  The album was produced in 2012 and denotes the struggle we all face while figuring out life, attempting to become the best versions of ourselves in the process.  It’s a very introspective work of art and something that I remember listening to when it came out.  

For the inspiration of the weave, I feel the album is about the mess and dirtiness of life, about how making mistakes is how we become who we’re meant to be. For me, I see this as natural browns and simple patterns.  The spirit of the album, however, reminds me that even if someone hits absolute rock bottom, the beauty of life is merely around the preverbal corner if they but wait.  This is why I decided to keep most of the patterns simple but wanted to experiment with simple, flowering beauty near the latter half of the textile to denote the blossoming beauty in each of us.  Let’s take a look at the loom setup:

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly5_4.jpeg"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly5_5.jpeg"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly5_6.jpeg"></p>

For the first part of the weave, I wanted to weave a simple tabby to give structure to the cloth and to align the warp yarns following the previous user’s extensive patterns on the loom.  This also gave me an opportunity to get used to an 8 shaft loom when, previously, I only had experience using a single frame loom.  Here is a look at about 2” of tabby to get started and find my groove.  This stretch of tabby was woven using an acrylic, brown yarn and I’m quite glad I started with tabby as it demonstrated that some of the warps were not as taught as they needed to be - I made the adjustments for tension and was able to have a strip of tabby to cut the sample off in the end.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly5_7.jpeg"></p>

Following the tabby, I switched to working with raw silk, also in a lighter, natural, almost brown color.  I began with tabby to lay the write structure for such a thin diameter yarn and began to weave a twill, which is a progression of frames to create a shifting, floating structure.  Once I began a few rows of this silk, I began to also interlace the conductive yarn for bonus credit.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly5_8.jpeg"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly5_9.jpeg"></p>

After the introduction of the conductive yarn, I decided that I wanted to create two strips of conductive yarn in the next section that was near-to invisible but would conduct and would alter resistance when touched together.  Since the loom tie up was different on each side of the loom, I decided to wave those strands from both ends and only allow them to penetrate about 2” into the middle of the cloth and, when the next frame was raised, locate the closest applicable warp to return under toward the outside edges of the textile.  This created a section approx. 1” x 2” on each side that can be touched together with the use of sensors.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly5_10.jpeg"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly5_11.jpeg"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly5_12.jpeg"></p>

The grey yarn is also acrylic and I decided to create an almost twill structure (repeating, anyway) by beginning with the middle shafts (4&5), then working outward (3&6, 2&7, 1&8) and then return back to center (2&7, 3&6, 4&5…) to repeat the process.  This created a diamond pattern structure in the cloth on the left side of the structure and a complex twill like structure on the right.  I chose the grey yarn as a subtle nod to the album about the beauty that can come from life in simple ways.

Here is the final product for my two hours on the loom:

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly5_13.jpeg"></p>

<b>Reflection</b>

This was a really enjoyable exercise and I’m really looking forward to using the 8-shaft loom to begin making foldable structures.  I think experimenting with these structures has shown me the power of choosing your tie-up pattern and how you can make seemingly complex patterns with little effort if the planning is done in advance.  I’d also like to explore how to use the conductive yarn is a usable way in the future but I still find my affinity for natural materials after deciding to use almost all acrylic on this assignment.

## Midterm - Experimental Swatches

<b>What I am setting out to do:</b>

<i>Assignment Details: Use the weekly template to describe the process of your midterm. Your documentation should include photos of at least three swatches that you created as you worked on the midterm as well as the drafts for those swatches.

<i>Identify at least three key decision points in your process where you changed plans, tried something new, or developed a new approach to optimize your swatch towards your heuristic.

<i>Describe these in writing. This is the primary place in the assignment where I will grade you on your decisions so provide strong reasoning for why you tried different techniques at different times.

<i>Include a reflection at the end of the documentation about what you would still like to try or what you think you should have done differently.

For my midterm I wanted to play around with dissolvable thread and determine how it would act within a fabric and exposed to water.  Lifejackets for sailors use salt crystals to keep self-inflating vests from inflating with a CO2 cartridge until they are melting away from being soaked in water.  I thought that some other naval purposes could be found by using a sugar based thread/fabric and was curious how different weaving structures would affect the capability of the thread (time to dissolve).  This is what I ended on: I will experiment with structure around dissolvable thread weft picks and will time how long it takes to dissolve each swatch based on their structures to see if structure affects the dissolvable yarn’s dissolution rate. For fun, maybe I can integrate other weft materials to get a pattern to appear after the thread dissolves.

Here is a sketch of the idea:

<p align="center"><img src="/images/midtermIdea.png"></p>

With an understanding that the most entangled weaves (greater amount of interlacements) tend to have the most stable structure, I decided I wanted to produce a tabby structure for testing and I also decided that twill, with its frequent commonality in fabrics, as my second choice.  My third structure, I decided, was to create a basket weave and see how those three compared to a piece of thread dissolving by itself.

<b>Process Notes</b>

With an idea in my mind to begin weaving just three different structures, I felt inspired working with the new floor loom and due to its much quicker speed, was able to add a couple of structures to the assignment to fulfill my curiosity as well adjust my third structure choice.  After setup, I began to see how the thread interwove with the cotton and with Laura’s in-class challenge to see if different shapes could be produced after contact with water, I made my first major adjustment in the project - I would drop the basket weave and begin playing with some conductive yarn and other paired yarns to see if I could alter the final structure.  In the end, I chose the following:

Swatch 1: Floating wefts, using the dissolving thread
Swatch 2: Floating cotton wefts (to hold structure together after dissolving thread)
Swatch 3: Tabby Weave with conductive yarn
Swatch 4: Twill
Swatch 5: Tabby

For the weaving, I was going to use an 8-shaft table loom and when I showed up for another late shift of fun, our newly warped floor loom was staring me in the face and challenging me to give it a go (second shift in the original plan to use a tabletop loom).  Weaving the structures themselves took about 90 minutes and resulted in approximately 15” of cloth.  The warp fibers were pre-selected and not chosen by me but I thought the color scheme quite bright and vivid for the exercise.  Here is the final resulting fabric on the loom:

The weaving was only one small portion of this project as each approx. 3” section of woven cloth would need to yield four samples (three for the swatch assignment and 1 for testing).  After getting the fabric home, I began carving up the pieces into their swatches using a sewing machine.  I originally was going to only produce two samples of each swatch but in my final change in the plan, I realized that I would have difficulty finding something to record the dissolving process in if I went much larger than a 3”x3” swatch.  For this reason, I made my third adjustment to the plan to create smaller and more numerous swatches.  This would also allow me to test more if I found that my results were troubling.

After I cut up the swatches into as close to the same size as possible, I then sewed the unbound edges together to keep the swatches in place while testing.  Following the swatch preparation, I prepared the testing area and began preparing for documentation.

The results of this experiment were quite interesting and not what I expected.  As a start, I tested a single thread to determine the effect I was waiting to see and kept all of the water around the same temperature - 79-80*F.  It became obvious quickly that the thread was made from a sugar based fiber and it created a sticky gel after a few seconds of water contact.  After recording that observation, I recorded the process for each of the structure types.  Here are the results:

| Swatch | Time to Dissolve | Observation |
|-------|--------|---------|
| String | 28 Seconds | Kept dissolving after I thought it was finished - seemed to be a result of the thread winding around itself when it started to react to the water |
| 1 | 30 Seconds | The dissolvable threads grabbed onto each other in a goopy mess and took a while to dissolve.  After 30 seconds, the dissolving ceased into a beautiful spiral structure |
| 2 | 25 Seconds | This swatch dissolved quickly but closed up like a clam - it didn’t respond as quickly or aggressively as the other swatches as I keep the accompanying cotton strands loose in the structure |
| 3 | 26 Seconds | Dissolved quickly and bound itself up from corner to corner |
| 4 | 25 Seconds | Rolled up like a taco in two different directions - this one seemed bound tightly and responded as such when dissolved |
| 5 | 25 Seconds | Twisted up nicely but not as tightly as expected - it did hold itself together very tightly once dried though, which makes me wonder how much of the sticky thread was absorbed into the cotton warp |

Here are snapshots of the final results:

The setup I had held the swatches well but did require them to curl up a little bit - this is definitely an area for future improvement but I found the exercise really fascinating and fun.  Building a textile and cutting it up afterwards was a bit nerve-wracking but now that I’ve completed the process, I really enjoyed it and have already begun to think of how to spin different organic structures into textiles to see how they perform.

<b>Reflection</b>

After completing this assignment, I really enjoyed playing with the different structure and seeing how they behave.  In the future, I’d like to look at changing up the warp to something a little less “grippy”, perhaps recycled plastic, and see if the slick warp fibers would behave like the bonded warp yarns did from the cotton fibers.  Another area I’d like to try exploring if I continued with this experiment would be to see how directed hydration affects structure and if target dissolution of the fabric can be achieved.

## Final project

<b>What I am setting out to do:</b>

<em>Assignment Details: This deliverable is almost identical to the midterm in that you will turn in via canvas a weekly-style reflection on the part of your project completed between the midterm and findings. Use the weekly template to describe the process of your final. Your documentation should include photos of at least three swatches that you created as you worked on the final (created after the midterm) as well as the drafts for those swatches.</em>

<em>Identify at least three key decision points in your process where you changed plans, tried something new, or developed a new approach to optimize your swatch towards your heuristic.</em>

<em>Include a reflection at the end of the documentation about what you would still like to try or what you think you should have done differently. </em>

For the final, my goal was to take the midterm and expand upon the concepts and learnings therein.  The result of this goal is that I’d like to see if I can create a “tear-away” textile that is activated with water.  I’m not completely sure if this will be something wearable or a conceptual fabric, but I think it makes sense to continue the learnings of the midterm in this direction.  I contemplated doing a double-weave but I’m fairly intimidated by the affair and whatever I fully decide to do, it will need to be on the cricket loom as I will not have the flexibility, nor the energy, to head into the lab to use the larger looms for this project.  

As a reminder of the midterm results, here is what happened when the samples were exposed to water for approximately 30 seconds:

<p align="center"><img src="/images/final1.png"></p>

These are the structures that I used in that testing exercise (in order of appearance):
<ol>
  <li>Swatch 1: Floating wefts, using the dissolving thread</li>
  <li>Swatch 2: Floating cotton wefts (to hold structure together after dissolving thread)</li>
  <li>Swatch 3: Tabby Weave with conductive yarn</li>
  <li>Swatch 4: Twill</li>
  <li>Swatch 5: Tabby</li>
</ol>

In the end, my approach, whether double or single weave, is to create some supplemental warps, in concert with dissolvable wefts, to see if I can create a textile that will fall apart and lose its structural integrity after being exposed to the water.  I think this will also be helpful with rounding out my heuristic on measuring how long it takes for differing structures to dissolve in water when using dissolvable yarn.  I haven’t completely thought through the applications of this experimentation but I am excited to be inspired by the results.

<em>Update: I think this needs to be a double layered textile as much as I’ve been avoiding it.  The idea of creating something like that is incredibly intimidating to me and I don’t have a full understanding of how it works although I’ve watched hours of videos on it.  I think it’s best that I take this approach and just keep staring at it but I will start out building my confidence with some tear-away cloth in a single dimension (note: change 1, discussed below). I’m thinking that it really needs to be a bracelet or something that can be worn for demonstrative and application purposes. </em>

<b>Process Notes</b>

For this project, I’m exclusively using the cricket loom - a table top, direct tie-up loom built by Schacht Spindle, located here in Boulder, CO.  I chose this loom due to my inability to access the wolf 8-shaft and other larger looms and to give myself time to experiment and work through what I want this project to be.  However, I need to build some confidence and find that using single-layer textiles is the best thing for me at the moment, so that’s where I started in the project.  Let’s take a look at the setup:

<p align="center"><img src="/images/final2.jpg"></p>

(Yes, that’s one of my daughters with her DIY book-loom #ProudDad)

From the previous exercise, I knew that I produced quite a few differing structures for testing but I was having trouble thinking of how to elevate this project from the midterm.  The first couple of samples I produced were simple but I knew deep down that I really needed to produce some double-woven structures for this application and so I began to double weave a tubular structure (insert change 1 here).  The reason I decided to go this route was because I knew it was something I was avoiding (a true test that you know you need to learn something and are just being difficult with yourself about it) and because the application of a wearable textile requires that the object have some form of wrapping capability to demonstrate that it can truly tear-away.  Here is what I designed using a plain double-weave within ADACAD.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/final3.jpg"></p>

The double-weave pattern, conceptualized, looks like this:

<p align="center"><img src="/images/final4.png"></p>

Following a very frustrating evening of creating said double-weave, my sample fell apart as I was trying to complete it by sewing and binding the ends, due to its small size.  I gave up at this point and decided I needed some assistance but I was certain I was on the correct path.

Following class, some heated discussion on how frustrating double-weaving is when you’re  first starting out, and a lengthy read in Jane Patrick’s “The Weaver’s Ideabook,” I decided to re-warp the loom and begin again.  This time, I knew that I would figure it out and would find that I could create a worthy sample.

The result was a conversation with Dr. Laura Devendorf (Director of the Unstable Design Lab), Etta Sandra (Resident Artist of the Unstable Design Lab), and Dover Horesh (fellow foxhole compatriot in the class) that got my brain spinning on ways to bind the ends of fabric that would still be dissolvable.  Change 2, my decision to use hobby glue, was the saving grace behind keeping such a small fabric, especially created on a cricket loom without a beater.  The result is below:

<p align="center"><img src="/images/final5.jpg"></p>

The resulting samples are bracelet sized and are bound only at the edges, creating a successful tubular structure for my first swatch.  Following that swatch, however, I noticed that the structure was beaten really tightly so that the warp and weft were sandwiched tightly together.  On the second swatch, I kept it the same structure, but used less force while beating, resulting in a much more uniform structure that may respond better to testing as the yarns are not as compacted.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/final6.jpg"></p>

As this assignment requires two swatches to be made, I had to use my original third swatch to do the sample testing.  Surprisingly, the sample took twice as long as the single layer cloths to unravel.  The results, however, still demonstrate that the textile is capable of losing its structural integrity if both a dissolvable warp and weft are used.  In the end, the testing took  nearly 60 seconds to complete and required a lot of manual manipulation to fully dissolve.  However, the results are encouraging that this type of sample is possible, it may just take a few more iterations of design to fully realize.  

<p align="center"><img src="/images/final7.jpg"></p>

After immersion in water, we find that the textile loses structural integrity and unravels.

The last thing I’d like to share is the user testing that demonstrated that this can be worn by a human.  Unfortunately, she was very hesitant to return it after testing.

<b>Reflection</b>

It may sound foolish but I’m really proud of myself for doing this assignment as I originally intended instead of being bullied by my fear of double weaving.  I feel accomplished from the exercise and eager to begin weaving more complex structures in the future.  One area that I would certainly revisit on this assignment in the future is the yarn weight/thickness and the material used in concert with the dissolvable thread.  I found that the thickness of the dissolvable yarn could be causing too much material to bleed into surrounding yarns and this causes a gluing effect that will need to be overcome.  Further, the surrounding yarns, if porous or exhibiting grabbing effects on the dissolvable yarn, should be replaced with more suitable fiber that is less likely to absorb the plant sugar that the dissolvable thread is made out of, resulting in a more seamless “pull-away” effect.

A special thanks to Dr. Laura Devendorf and the rest of the Unstable Lab for their help and support learning how to weave this semester.  I truly hope I have the opportunity to work with each of you again in the near future! /J
