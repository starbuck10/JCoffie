## Weekly 1 - Learning how to Document Textiles

For my documentation setup, I’m going to use my desk (image 1) to lay out my prototypes and textiles for documentation by relocating the printer (and fan) - I have overhead light in this space underneath the shelving as well as accent lighting and controllable natural light, so it’s ideal for this process.  I also purchased a 20x macro lens to get close-up images and the kit came with a couple of other lens that I can use to see if they will help with the documentation process as well (link: shorturl.at/bhmU0).

<b>Woven Object Exploration</b>

The object I wanted to explore for this assignment was a camel wool blanket that I purchased in Kandahar, Afghanistan when I was stationed there in support of Operation: Enduring Freedom.  I purchased the blanket at a bazaar and actually traded an American watch for it with the merchant - it’s a very simple design and after 10 years, it has a bit of shed but it still holding up strong.

The decoration around the outside of the blanket, which appears to be a series of geometric patterns, also provides a much need visual break from the singular color of the blanket.  It appears to also be only a single layer which would make sense because it’s a fantastic blanket to use in Spring and Fall but can be very chilly to use in the winter and overbearing in the summer.

The final couple of shots of this blanket demonstrate the general weaving pattern that the blanket uses for the more mundane component of browns, which makes up the majority of the weaving.  I find that this pattern produces a very strong blanket and after 10 years of daily usage, it still holds up quite strong.
