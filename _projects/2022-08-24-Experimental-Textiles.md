## Weekly 1 - Learning how to Document Textiles

For my documentation setup, I’m going to use my desk (image 1) to lay out my prototypes and textiles for documentation by relocating the printer (and fan) - I have overhead light in this space underneath the shelving as well as accent lighting and controllable natural light, so it’s ideal for this process.  I also purchased a 20x macro lens to get close-up images and the kit came with a couple of other lens that I can use to see if they will help with the documentation process as well (link: shorturl.at/bhmU0).

<b>Woven Object Exploration</b>

The object I wanted to explore for this assignment was a camel wool blanket that I purchased in Kandahar, Afghanistan when I was stationed there in support of Operation: Enduring Freedom.  I purchased the blanket at a bazaar and actually traded an American watch for it with the merchant - it’s a very simple design and after 10 years, it has a bit of shed but it still holding up strong.

The decoration around the outside of the blanket, which appears to be a series of geometric patterns, also provides a much need visual break from the singular color of the blanket.  It appears to also be only a single layer which would make sense because it’s a fantastic blanket to use in Spring and Fall but can be very chilly to use in the winter and overbearing in the summer.

The final couple of shots of this blanket demonstrate the general weaving pattern that the blanket uses for the more mundane component of browns, which makes up the majority of the weaving.  I find that this pattern produces a very strong blanket and after 10 years of daily usage, it still holds up quite strong.

## Weekly 2 - Making a Loom

<b>What I am setting out to do:</b>

The assignment for the week is to watch a Youtube video on making a loom using a hardcover book (link: shorturl.at/ar278) and then to get out and make one ourselves. The specifications of the build are as follows:

1. It should have at least 20 ends/warps
2. Use at least 2 colors
3. Weave those two colors in any combination
4. Integrate at least 12” of ductile yarn into the weave
5. And weave something that relates to the contents of the book
The last requirement of the assignment is to ask ourselves what else we could make a loom out of.
My approach is to use one of my hardcover sailing books and to play around with an ocean theme throughout the assignment. I chose a turquoise for the warp as well as for one of the wefts and accompanied that color with a natural raw silk and gold/brown ductile yarn. The idea is that the gold/brown could play as land, as viewed from above, the turquoise would be the ocean, and the natural raw silk tan coloration could play almost white as clouds or even as waves, depending on how each of the patterns surfaces.
A couple of things I wanted to explore were: how many differing patterns you could generate and how they should be woven to transition between them simply by using an alternating warp lift, the technicality of how each weft begins and ends (is it best to cut yarn and reinsert or to carry along the outer edging?), and discover how tension in the yarn can affect the weave pattern as a whole.

<b>Process Notes</b>

The first thing I did was construct the loom by following the instructional video above. I had the warp incredibly taught against the book in an attempt to keep the warp evenly spaced throughout the build as I reasoned that tension would be more a friend than adversary. I bound the warp tightly against the book and also triple taped the back of the loom (then stole one of those pieces to build a loom with my daughter Emmalyn). It consists of 20 warps and three differing weft colors and materials as outlined perviously. I used popsicle sticks for the heddles and half of a chopstick to guide the wefts.

Because I wanted to explore different interviewing with the weft to determine the technical components of the build, I decided to transition the weave pattern every couple of passes to experiment with differing conditions. The first pattern, a simple back and forth between the raw silk and the turquoise yarn transitions into just turquoise and then just raw silk (Figure 2).

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly2_2.jpeg"></p>

Following this simple beginning, I staggered a few rows of the weft back and forth and then began interweaving the conductive yarn. Once this was done for a few rows, I transitioned to a half conductive yarn and half raw silk and then back to dedicated turquoise (Figure 3). This process created a look on the textile that resembled a cloud and I thought it was a neat nod to the story of the book.

Next, I interwove the conductive yarn in a couple of more rows because I was curious about whether I should terminate that thread and tuck it or carry it up along the edge. The reasoning was that if I wanted to send signal along any of these bands to another, they would need to be interconnected. In the future, however, I think I would weave this thread into the passing warp rows to hide it and keep it from getting snagged (Figure 4).

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly2_4.jpeg"></p>

Finally, I ended the weave with more raw silk work and a final bit of conductive yarn. I liked this pattern because it resembled waves breaking against the shore and was a nice way to end this assignment (Figure 5).

<p align="center"><img src="/images/weekly2_5.jpeg"></p>

Overall, the build measures about a finger-span long and about 1.25” W. I find the pattern soothing although I can distinguish areas of inconsistent tension and a gradual narrowing of the warp as the weave continued. Once I realized that this tension was too much, I decided to begin experimenting with how the warp would lay given more tension as it progressed. The weave certainly changed in feel and texture and the distinction between colors became more obvious (Figure 6).

<b>Reflection</b>

I found this hand-on introduction to looming to be really fun and just what I needed to see how each component of the loom contributes to the design. I learned a few wrong techniques and began to find a rhythm when I started to understand how the heddles had to work together for increased efficiency. I had such a blast with this assignment that I actually built a smaller one with my daughter Emmalyn and we started her own textile too (Figure 7)! I should probably figure out how we keep the textile together while off the book before I get too much further...
