## The Intro

Our vision for this project was to present an interactive and impactful exhibit that helps the world understand the struggle that many nations are going through as a result of global warming.  With massive famines across much of the World, very little attention is given to the small island nations whose low elevation has driven many people from their homes.  Even worse, entire islands are disappearing with the advent of climate refugees.  Our mission was to bring attention to this timely and scary issue by designing an escape room that teaches visitors about the impacts of global warming.  Staged as a fact finding mission to educate the International Community, this game is designed to educate, excited, and provide a low-budget experience that truly leaves people changed.

Here was our overall vision for the project:

## Let's meet the team!
Our team consisted of 4 members from the CU Boulder ATLAS Master's community but each with very differing backgrounds in design and technology.

## Project Vision and Design

The purpose of the project wass to create an experience where visitors to the exhibit walk away informed of the plight of small island nations and have the desire to step up as a puzzle piece in the solution to global warming.  This vision, encapsulated by our initial and ambitious design, demonstrates how even a little technology can be used to maximize the storytelling experience.

The Technical Side of Things:

The cooperation button was an idea we had that wasn't really possible to do within our technological constraints outlined below, but this part of the project involved requiring bnoth players to push a button on opposite sides of the room - halfway through the game, our timer was to pick up speed and the only way to restore it to its normal pace was to have buttons on opposite sides of the room depressed simultaneously.

## Prototyping

Our prototyping progress update - culmination of clue layout and the realization that we have a bit of game design left to do:

Simultaneously, we worked on developing the projection of our small island nation going under water to add suspense to the game design.  Preetum developed a layered P5js sketch to build up the scene and the layering progress can be seen here:

And to add more fun to the mix, we elected to use an arduino and a push button and LCD screen to create a bit more of a technical prototype of activating the game.

## User testing

Although brief in this exhibit, we did use usability practices to design and develop the experience, alter clues, and eventually add sound and sound responsive lighting to the exhibit.  Here is some of our user testing results and the process in action:

<p align="center"><img src="/images/clueTest.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/userFeedback.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/userTest2.jpg"></p>

What we discovered from this interaction was that our clues needed to be adjusted for timing, our 2 hour timer was incredibly excessive, and we also discovered that the game was a bit too intense for the experience to be anything but defeating.  For this reason, we ended up adjusting the video projection to be a bit more fun and lower fidelity to not intimidate guests, which is demonstrated in the video above.

## Developing Clues for the Escape Room

Physical and digital clues were quite difficult to make hard enough to entertain but easy enough to solve in the time limit and also teach a lesson.  Here is a breakout of the clues we decided to use in the final game, understanding we needed a mix of complexity and interactive experiences to keep our audience engaged:

## Uh oh... Houston, we've got 100 problems and this tech is one of them!

In an effort to keep our tech build on task, we elected as a team to come in after hours and assemble the various components and we are certainly glad we did.  The electronic door lock we were planning to use got backordered and the only one available in time used an AC/DC converter which arrived broken and unusable.  We also faced a shortage of Raspberry Pi devices and Joshua couldn't locate his in time for the project.  Even better, our touchpad interface screen was not compatible with mac and as the code would take a while to interface with, we used Preetam's touchscreen PC and found we had no use for it.  Finally, our project required a short-throw project, none of which were available nor within budget.  Although the an opportunity to fall prey to the uncertainties of life, we decided to take a different look at the problems and,  instead, we hunkered down and decided to use a screen instead of a project, use a touchscreen PC instead of our touchpad interface, remove the raspberry pi and run off the local machine, and  use an alarm and timer system with an Arduino for the escape room instead of a locking door.  Oh, and did I mention that the space we were going to present in was also too small, temporary, and unable to allow more setup time than the day of for our exhibit?  Good thing we have pop-up tents and cardboard available!  All-in-all, these unexpected surprises added to the charm of the exhibit and we determined that setting the escape room in an "exhibit mode" allowed us to educate a wide audience without creating a queue for accessing the message we wanted to present.  It turns out that if you're patient and creative, things turn out for the best in the end.

## ATLAS EXPO 2022

Hosted each year by the Roser ATLAS Institute at CU Boulder, the EXPO is an opportunity for students of ATLAS to demonstrate their work.  This year, over 70 groups presented their work to the public in areas of robotics, usability, social impact, and creative technology.  We elected to present our exhibit at EXPO this year which added to complex nature of our project.  With only 8am-4pm available for setup the day of the event, our project had to be sleek and slim enough to build and present in a very limited timeframe.

Let's take a look at the progress of the build!

## The final product

After a grueling and incredibly fast 6 hours, we had our final exhibit for display at EXPO.  The result was more than we expected and the welcome was phenomenal.  Although we determined that the initial appearance and design as an escape room would be a bit more instructive and deliberate, the final project was much better suited to the venue and we saw hundreds of guests during the two hours window of exhibit time.  Here's a look at the final product:

## Lessons learned

What'd we learn from the experience?

Joshua: "My biggest takeaway is the power of imagination - people aren't looking for mind-blowing futuristic tech, they're looking for experience.  If you provide visitors with experience, with just the right dash of WOAH, you'll be lightyears ahead of futurism.  Trust others' imaginations and insights and always be willing to adapt to constraints - afterall, that's what makes this worthwhile and fun."

Julia: "I learned how important it is to be adaptable. It's pretty vital to know when to scale down or change plans based on time constraints, finances, etc. Also, learning to incorporate a lot of different ideas was a really fun challenge. It was great to see everyone's creativity shine through while making one cohesive project."

Preetum: "I've learned the value of working as a team and maintaining positive relationships with team members. It's important to understand that sometimes progressing small goals is more important than perfection. It's all about the joy of coming together to achieve a goal that everyone on the team believes in. Receiving feedback assisted us in focusing on the most important aspects of the project and getting us on the right track. It was a lot of fun creating a tangible solution that incorporated various technologies. Overall, it was a rewarding experience to collaborate with my teammates, mentors, and everyone else involved."

Shivangi: "."


Overall, we couldn't be happier with the experience.  Through ups and downs, uncertainty and unexpected curveballs, we created an exhibit we were proud of and that we hope will encourage others to explore the impacts of global warming on our planet and the people that reside here.
