## The Intro

Our vision for this project was to present an interactive and impactful exhibit that helps the world understand the struggle that many nations are going through as a result of global warming.  With massive famines across much of the World, very little attention is given to the small island nations whose low elevation has driven many people from their homes.  Even worse, entire islands are disappearing with the advent of climate refugees.  Our mission was to bring attention to this timely and scary issue by designing an escape room that teaches visitors about the impacts of global warming.  Staged as a fact finding mission to educate the International Community, this game is designed to educate, excited, and provide a low-budget experience that truly leaves people changed.

Here was our overall vision for the project:

## Project Vision and Design

The purpose of the project wass to create an experience where visitors to the exhibit walk away informed of the plight of small island nations and have the desire to step up as a puzzle piece in the solution to global warming.  This vision, encapsulated by our initial and ambitious design, demonstrates how even a little technology can be used to maximize storytelling.

## Prototyping

Our prototyping progress update - culmination of clue layout and the realization that we have a bit of game design left to do:

Simultaneously, we worked on developing the projection of our small island nation going under water to add suspense to the game design.  Preetum developed a layered P5js sketch to build up the scene and the layering progress can be seen here:

And to add more fun to the mix, we elected to use an arduino and a push button and LCD screen to create a bit more of a technical prototype of activating the game.

## User testing

Although brief in this exhibit, we did use usability practices to design the experience... change clues, add sound to the experience.  Add in images/user experience documentation.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/userFeedback.jpg"></p>

What we discovered from this interaction was that our clues needed to be adjusted for timing, our 2 hour timer was incredibly excessive, and we also discovered that the game was a bit too intense for the experience to be anything but defeating.  For this reason, we ended up adjusting the video projection to be a bit more fun and lower fidelity to not intimidate guests.

## Developing Clues in the Escape Room

Physical and digital clues

## Uh oh... Houston, we've got 100 problems and this tech is one of them!

Describe changes to the plan after prototyping (includes door locking system, escape room shell - cardboard + tent instead of wood framing + door, touchpad interface - no mac connectivity, used computer with touchscreen instead PC, short throw projector to screen)

## ATLAS EXPO 2022

Hosted each year by the Roser ATLAS Institute at CU Boulder, the EXPO is an opportunity for students of ATLAS to demonstrate their work.  This year, over 70 groups presented their work to the public in areas of robotics, usability, social impact, and creative technology.  We elected to present our exhibit at EXPO this year which added to complex nature of our project.  With only 8am-4pm available for setup the day of the event, our project had to be sleek and slim enough to build and present in a very limited timeframe.

Let's take a look at the progress of the build!

## Lessons learned

What'd we learn from the experience?

Joshua: "My biggest takeaway is the power of imagination - people aren't looking for mind-blowing futuristic tech, they're looking for experience.  If you provide visitors with experience, with just the right dash of WOAH, you'll be lightyears ahead of futurism.  Trust other's imaginations and always be willing to adapt to constraints."

Julia: "I learned how important it is to be adaptable. It's pretty vital to know when to scale down or change plans based on time constraints, finances, etc. Also, learning to incorporate a lot of different ideas was a really fun challenge. It was great to see everyone's creativity shine through while making one cohesive project."

Preetum: "I've learned the value of working as a team and maintaining positive relationships with team members. It's important to understand that sometimes progressing small goals is more important than perfection. It's all about the joy of coming together to achieve a goal that everyone on the team believes in. Receiving feedback assisted us in focusing on the most important aspects of the project and getting us on the right track. It was a lot of fun creating a tangible solution that incorporated various technologies. Overall, it was a rewarding experience to collaborate with my teammates, mentors, and everyone else involved."
