## Generative Code

As part of my Graduate studies at CU Boulder ATLAS, I've been playing around with generative art, learning how to use code to create visualizations, filters, and media that invokes thought and reflection.  It is often these visualizations that capture human imagination and allows for constructive discourse as we try to make the World a better place together.

Here are a couple of lessons-learned from the experience:

* Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly.  If you're waiting for perfection, you will never discover what your projects or plans can become.  Then, when you have a prototype, iterate!
* Always plan for multiple iterations - you'll never be completely happy with your product and that's okay.  Art is more about discovery than a final solution so start small and build from there.
* If all of the problems in the World were technical, they would've been solved by now.  Take your time, be expressive with your solutions, and allow beauty to change the World, not just debate.

> “Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away.” – Antoine de Saint-Exupery

With all of that out of the way, let's take a look at some projects!

### Think Outside the Fox

This coding project uses a variety of shapes and colors to create a a geometric fox with random eye color changes and mouse triggered laser eyes with galactic background.  The inspiration behind this project comes from my love of animals and encourages the viewer to take a different approach to their own internal problem solving.

## Solar System Perspective

Scaled model of solar system that demonstrates the relative size of planets and their rotation speed (sped up for illustration but scaled, nevertheless).  This piece puts the viewer in a position of awe as they see their insignificance in our own small Solar System.
