## Generative Code

As part of my Graduate studies at CU Boulder ATLAS, I've been playing around with generative art, learning how to use code to create visualizations, filters, and media that invokes thought and reflection.  It is often these visualizations that capture human imagination and allows for constructive discourse as we try to make the World a better place together.

Here are a couple of lessons-learned from the experience:

* Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly.  If you're waiting for perfection, you will never discover what your projects or plans can become.  Then, when you have a prototype, iterate!
* Always plan for multiple iterations - you'll never be completely happy with your product and that's okay.  Art is more about discovery than a final solution so start small and build from there.
* If all of the problems in the World were technical, they would've been solved by now.  Take your time, be expressive with your solutions, and allow beauty to change the World, not just debate.

> “Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away.” – Antoine de Saint-Exupery

With all of that out of the way, let's take a look at some projects!
