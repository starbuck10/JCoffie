## The Exhibit

LIVING EXHIBIT - MYCELIUM

A living diorama/terrarium that incorporates biological life, 3d printing, and an artistic display into a fictitious world...

Where man's purpose is to support and caretake the Earth...
Mushrooms grow to fantastical heights, changing the landscape...
And death and decay return our world to life...

A reverse, "Giving Tree" thought-experiment exploring man's role and the effects of regenerating life through death by the cultivation of mycelium.

## Background and Inspiration

## What the Future Brings

## Acknowledgements

This experiment wouldn't have been possible without the help of a group of really smart and talented people.  I'd like to thank Justin Gitlin (<a href="https://cacheflowe.com">Cacheflowe</a>) for advising me in this project and pointing me in the right direction when I found myself stuck.  His insight and advice was invaluable and I am incredibly grateful.  Thanks you, Justin!  

Thank you to <a href ="">Netta Offer </a> for her guidance and advice in the biological component of the build - our conversations were instrumental in conducting my first mycelium project and it was such a pleasure.  Thanks and I hope we get to work together on projects again in the future!

And finally, I'd also like to thank my resident scientist, progress photography, psychologist, and wife Kimberly, for the late night conversations and helping me craft the story of this thought experiment.  Thanks, sweetie!
