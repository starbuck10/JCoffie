## The Exhibit

LIVING EXHIBIT - MYCELIUM

A living diorama/terrarium that incorporates biological life, 3d printing, and an artistic display into a fictitious world...

<em>Where man's purpose is to support and caretake the Earth...
Mushrooms grow to fantastical heights, changing the landscape...
And death and decay return our world to life...</em>

A reverse, "<a href="https://www.shelsilverstein.com/9780060256654/the-giving-tree/">Giving Tree</a>" thought-experiment exploring man's role and the effects of regenerating life through death by the cultivation of mycelium.

## Background and Inspiration

Coming up with the idea for this self-study project was a long process.  I knew I wanted to create a display or exhibit and I wanted a biological component, but it wasn't until I began exploring the uses of mycelium in construction methods that this idea spawned.  With inspiration from a variety of other sources, the idea for this thought-experiment began to take hold.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/final_inspiration.jpg"></p>

With the concept slowly coming together in my mind, I began a layout diagram to keep the story in line with the installation.  The final drafted result is below.

## Applied Technologies and Design Considerations

Lighting: FastLED for water-resistant flickering LED lamps and used a standard blacklight LED strip to create a glow to the exhibit.

Printing: Glow-in-the-dark PLA with 3d printing and designs for homes, mushrooms, bridge, cliff support, and accents

<p align="center"><img src="/images/IMG_3018.png"></p>

Soil: Natural clay, modeling clay for cliff for flexibility, dung soil, and coco coir for top layer and small stones for pathway.  I did spend some time painting the modeling clay with acrylic paints to keep it from being so one dimensional as well.

Water: Syringe and living sponge

Construction methods: Hand-sculpted clay, drill press for impregnating log with mycelium spores, poly-fill for filtration, acrylic top using glue gun to hold components in place, acrylics and airbrush/hand brushing to add detail, and a large, 550 mL catheter syringe and surgical tubing to add water to display without contamination

Arduino: two fans to control humidity levels and code to run lighting - here is the code used to run the system.  The fans are controlled through a direct 5v power connection on the bread board as their max speed is the ideal airflow condition for growth

<p align="center"><img src="/images/arduino_code.jpg"></p>

## Lessons Learned

After initial installation, it was quickly apparent that fans and circulation would also need to be installed as the humid environment in a stagnant space quickly led to condensate around the entire display.  This also mean that the layout of the top of the tank decided would also have to be decided on quickly.  By snaking the black light LEDs around the acrylic lid and relocating/securing the bread board and Arduino, I was able to make room for the fan components and reduce the number of 120v plugs down to 2 to present the display, even though I added two more pieces of equipment to the mix.

Water, although present in the display, quickly became vapor and condensate that leaked through the holes in the display that I used to create circulation.  I didn't think this consequence through and I expected the the initially closed system to keep retaining moisture.  By using a large syringe, a small bowl shape in the clay, and a natural sponge to keep things moist, I was able to provide enough moisture to the mycelium while also keeping the water from spreading throughout the rest of the exhibit, while simultaneously clearing the glass of unwanted condensate.

## Mycelium

Growing the mycelium was AWESOME.  It was a really neat process and I was able to experiment with silicon molds as well as different substrates to help the organism grow.  I decided to use both blue and pink oyster mushrooms for this exhibit and ended up using the pink within the display.  When the UV lights are off, you can actually see the pink mycelium spreading throughout the tank.  Here are some images of the mycelium as it began to grow.

Finally, this is what my mycelium collection looks like today with the rest of the leftover growth not used in the exhibit.  I will give them a few more weeks before relocating them to experiment with fruiting

Of note, I cleaned the cylindrical, silicon molds after discovering they didn't take root as much as I had hoped.

## What the Future Brings

This exhibit is designed to grow over time and for an observer to capture but a moment in its life.  I hope to keep it growing over the next few months and present at the ATLAS EXPO 2023 in the Spring.  Feel free to join us there if you'd like to see what we've all been up to lately.

## Acknowledgements

This experiment wouldn't have been possible without the help of a group of really smart and talented people.  I'd like to thank Justin Gitlin (<a href="https://cacheflowe.com">Cacheflowe</a>) for advising me in this project and pointing me in the right direction when I found myself stuck.  His insight and advice was invaluable and I am incredibly grateful.  Thanks you, Justin!  

Thank you to <a href ="https://www.colorado.edu/atlas/netta-ofer">Netta Ofer </a> for her guidance and advice in the biological component of the build - our conversations were instrumental in conducting my first mycelium project and it was such a pleasure.  Thanks and I hope we get to work together on projects again in the future!

And finally, I'd also like to thank my resident scientist, progress photography, psychologist, and wife Kimberly, for the late night conversations and helping me craft the story of this thought experiment.  Thanks, sweetie! /J
