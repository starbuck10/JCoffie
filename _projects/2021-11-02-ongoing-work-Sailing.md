## The Goal

I love sailing.  And I have a personal goal to own a blue-water sailboat that I can travel the World on.  Who doesn't have that goal, right?  Anyway, I've been working my way through certifications and hands-on experience to make the goal a reality.  Let's see how it's going!

## Step 1 - What's sailing?

Last year my brother and my mother gifted me with something that I never would have imagined would change my life - a birthday certificate to take ASA101 through <a href="https://victoriasailingschool.com">Victoria Sailing</a> here in Colorado.  I completed the course but before I made it all the way through, I knew sailing would become a hobby that would make a big difference in my own mental health by:

* Providing a mental escape from the busyness of our World
* Giving me an outlet for simplicity to help work through life's issues
* Generating a passion that will last a lifetime

I quickly signed up for the next course before my current one was complete and now I find myself wondering how to make this hobby a workable lifestyle for myself and my family.

So here's the goal: take the courses and gain the experience I need to become a full-blown ocean sailing Captain and take my family around the globe.

## Step 1 ASA101 - Basic Keelboat

ASA101 was a series of classroom instruction and on-vessel application of sailing skills.  Here is a description of the course from ASA: "Able to skipper a sloop-rigged keelboat of approximately 20 to 27 feet in length by day in light to moderate winds (up to 15 knots) and sea conditions. Knowledge of basic sailing terminology, parts and functions, helm commands, basic sail trim, points of sail, buoyage, seamanship and safety including basic navigation rules to avoid collisions and hazards. Auxiliary power operation is not required."

My key takeaway from the course: safety, safety, safety.  A skipper must be methodical, plan ahead, and put the safety of the crew above all else.

## Step 2 ASA 103 - Basic Coastal Cruising

ASA103 builds on ASA101 and provides a deeper understanding of the operation of a sail-driven vessel.  The ASA describes this course as "Able to skipper a sloop-rigged auxiliary powered (inboard or outboard engine) keelboat of approximately 25 to 35 feet length by day in moderate winds (up to 20 knots) and sea conditions. Knowledge of cruising sailboat terminology, basic boat systems, auxiliary engine operation, docking procedures, intermediate sail trim, navigation rules, basic coastal navigation, anchoring, weather interpretation, safety and seamanship."

My key takeaway from the course: Always safely operate your vessel but don't be afraid to make it your own - calm seas don't make seasoned sailors.  Take the time to find your limits and your vessels limits and learn to operate within those confines.

## Step 3: Buy a boat and rack up the hours!

Following the completion of my ASA101 and ASA103 courses, I decided to purchase a 26' MacGregor "trailer-sailor" to continue wracking up hours and to gain experience maintaining, repairing, and upgrading my own vessel.  And here she is!

I also had the opportunity to charter boats in anticipation of ASA104 next year and to broaden my experience on a variety of vessels.  Woohoo!

## The next step in the journey

The next step in the journey is to wait out the Winter!  I was invited to join a sailing team this spring and as the weather warms, I'm looking to purchase a smaller Dinghy to continue to build up hours. I'd like to park it by a lake/reservoir so that I can build the hours necessary to gain my USCG 6-pack Captains license while also looking for the best location to obtain the Yachmaster certification and commercial endorsement from RYA.  I'd also like to take the coursework necessary to begin as an ASA instructor so that I can generate additional income and continue to build our fleet while delivering and chartering boats with the Yachtmaster and 6-pack certifications.

Stretch goal of 2022: Complete my first vessel delivery and begin to develop a reputation for safety and dependability.  Fun stretch goal: Join a race team at Cherry Creek Reservoir in the spring.

## Update: Well, turns out you can plan for anything (5/2/2022)

But nothing will turn out as you plan!  Looks like I won't be pursuing the 6-pack or Yachtmaster certification this year but our family was presented with an amazing opportunity to restore and get an old 1976 Catalina C15 back in the water and racing.  I purchased the craft at Cherry Creek Reservoir (amidst a VERY snowy day and the marina decided to store the boat off of its trailer, so talk about a long day in getting it home) for $500 and we plan to use it to learn to maneuver a smaller craft and spend more time out on the water.  An added bonus is that I'm starting to add in sailing trips for those that suffer from anxiety this year as a way to provide a coping mechanism, particularly since the pandemic is beginning to ebb but our emotions haven't returned to normal.  This opportunity was simply too good to pass up.  Let's get into some images if we can!

<p align="center"><img src="/images/c15.jpg"></p>

Here is a shot of the hull after getting her home.

We replaced all of the standing rigging and all of the running rigging in her...

<p align="center"><img src="/images/repair.jpg"></p>

along with some gelcoat repair work...

<p align="center"><img src="/images/epoxy.jpg"></p>

and renovating the tiller, rudder, and swing keel.  The forestay came in too short from <a href = "https://www.catalinadirect.com">Catalina Direct</a> and I can't speak highly enough of that's shops willingness to make things right and to help with repairs along the way.  

So we have that forestay to replace and another coat of epoxy on the wood and we'll be ready to hit the water and check her seaworthiness!
